Task Management Spring Boot Application
Overview
This application is a simple Task Management system built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which helps separate concerns in the application. The application allows users to view and update task details, such as task title, description, and completion status.

IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any IDE that supports Java and Spring Boot)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-spring-boot.git
2. Navigate to the Project Folder
Change directory to the project folder:

cd task-management-spring-boot
3. Build the Application
Build the project using Maven to resolve dependencies:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
4. Run the Application
Run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

bash
Copy code

Application Structure
1. Model (taskManagment_SpringFrameWork.model)
Task.java: Represents a task with an ID, title, description, and completion status.
2. Controller (taskManagment_SpringFrameWork.controller)
TaskController.java: Handles HTTP requests. It uses the TaskService to manage task data and passes it to the view.
3. Service (taskManagment_SpringFrameWork.service)
TaskService.java: Provides the business logic for managing tasks. It retrieves and updates the task.
4. View (src/main/resources/templates)
TaskView.html: A Thymeleaf template for displaying and updating task details. It uses dynamic data provided by the controller.
Endpoints
1. GET / - View Task
URL: http://localhost:8080/
Description: Displays the current task's details (ID, title, description, and completion status).
Response: Displays the task details on the webpage.
2. POST /update - Update Task
URL: http://localhost:8080/update
Description: Updates the task details (title, description, and completion status).
Parameters:

Response: The updated task details are displayed on the webpage.
Example Workflow
View Task: Upon visiting the root URL (/), the user sees the task details.
Update Task: The user can modify the task title, description, and completion status using the form, which then updates the task and reflects the changes on the page.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For creating the backend of the application.
Thymeleaf: For rendering dynamic web pages on the front-end.
Maven: For project dependency management and build automation.
Conclusion
This simple Task Management system demonstrates how to build a web application using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf with the MVC design pattern. You can extend this application by adding features like task creation, deletion, or storing tasks in a database.
